# Good Practices for Software Development


## 1. Which point(s) were new to you?
- Asking questions in a structured way with screenshots or code snippets was new to me.
- Using group channels instead of private messages for better visibility was a useful insight.
- Tracking time regularly to improve focus and productivity was also new to me.


## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress?
I need to improve my communication and focus.
To make progress, I will:
- Ask clearer questions with proper details.
- Over-communicate when something blocks my work.
- Reduce distractions by keeping my phone silent.
- Follow focused work sessions and take proper breaks.
