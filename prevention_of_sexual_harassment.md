# Prevention of Sexual Harassment


## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment includes any **unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature** that makes someone feel uncomfortable, offended, or unsafe. Examples include:
- Unwanted physical contact (touching, hugging, pat-ping)
- Sexual comments, jokes, or remarks about someone’s body
- Requests for sexual favours or advances
- Showing sexually explicit material (images/videos)
- Spreading sexual rumours or gossip


## 2. What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?
If I see sexual harassment, I would:
- Speak up politely but firmly that the behaviour is unwelcome.
- Document incidents with date/time and details if possible.
- Report it to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or the appropriate authority at work.
- Seek support from HR, a trusted manager, or a senior colleague.
